How about that amazing interactive data visualization that you saw way back when, the one that made you want to level up your news nerd game? Good luck finding those stories today. Data journalism is disappearing from the web.

Data journalism is more fragile than most people realize. Every time a news organization reorganizes its staff or updates its CMS or stops paying the bill for the data team’s servers, complex data journalism projects are lost. Conventional archiving methods, like the Internet Archive’s crawlers or the automated archiving feeds of companies like Lexis-Nexis, are no longer sufficient to capture projects that involve big data, databases, streaming data or interactive graphics.

In this session, we’ll discuss why data journalism is the new digital ephemera, and we’ll explore the state of the art for archiving. We’ll talk about strategies data journalists can use to preserve their own work and how news organizations can better preserve their valuable digital assets.
