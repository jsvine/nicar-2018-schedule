        "description": "There are some 320 million people in the U.S., and 43 million of them were born abroad. About 11 million people are undocumented and over 5.1 million children have at least one undocumented parent. 860,000 people have applied for temporary legal status because they were brought to the U.S. without proper documentation as children. Over 500,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts. Some 270,000 people in the U.S. came as refugees. On any given day, about 40,000 people are in immigration detention.\n\nThe numbers surrounding immigration can be daunting and hard to track down. In this session, we\u2019ll go through some of the most useful datasets available and talk about some of the data that\u2019s a bit tougher to find. We\u2019ll talk about how to use that data to get leads on local and national stories \u2014 and what to do when the government is not providing data about its immigration actions.\n\nThis session is good for: Anyone. No technical skills are needed for this workshop, though a little bit of comfort with math and some perseverance will help.",

Little League organizations have virtually no oversight of their finances or rules. High school athletic associations are nonprofit groups that lord over millions of teenage athletes and can loft hefty punishments against students, most of whom never will play in college. And at colleges, TV money has tripled athletics revenue, which has warped spending at a lot of schools, enriching coaches and marketing agencies alike.\n\nBut name and likeness lawsuits, helmet safety issues, Title IX lawsuits, player pay and other issues have started demanding a piece of that money. At the same time, bribery scandals, academic fraud, sexual assault and other problems can make you wonder if anyone\u2019s really in charge. Here's what you need to know about the changing landscape and where to find documents and data to help uncover these important local sports stories.",

We\u2019ll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. This is an intermediate Excel class intended for those who have mastered the basics, such as sorting, filtering, pivot tables and using functions. It is a fast-paced class intended to introduce you to these tools. You'll walk out with practice data and a 20-page tipsheet that covers in detail everything we do in class, plus other great Excel tips.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.\n\nWorkshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use Pivot Tables.\n\nNOTE: Registration is required for this session.

How about that amazing interactive data visualization that you saw way back when, the one that made you want to level up your news nerd game? Good luck finding those stories today. Data journalism is disappearing from the web.\n\nData journalism is more fragile than most people realize. Every time a news organization reorganizes its staff or updates its CMS or stops paying the bill for the data team\u2019s servers, complex data journalism projects are lost. Conventional archiving methods, like the Internet Archive\u2019s crawlers or the automated archiving feeds of companies like Lexis-Nexis, are no longer sufficient to capture projects that involve big data, databases, streaming data or interactive graphics.\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll discuss why data journalism is the new digital ephemera, and we\u2019ll explore the state of the art for archiving. We\u2019ll talk about strategies data journalists can use to preserve their own work and how news organizations can better preserve their valuable digital assets. Finally, we\u2019ll report on how journalists, librarians and scholars are thinking about future-proofing the news.",
